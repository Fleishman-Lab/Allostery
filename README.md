# Allostery
Code accompanying the manuscript "Merging different allosteric mechanisms: the case of Escherichia coli glutathione reductase"
## the folder has 3 scripts:
1. A MATLAB solver that solves Eq. [S1] that is based on the reaction scheme depicted in Fig. 5.
2. A Jupyter Notebook that searches for sets of parameters for Eq. [S3] that produce the maximum Hill number.
3. A Jupyter Notebook that simulates how the internal homotropic Hill number affects the observed external Hill number using defined parameter values.
