# Allostery
Code accompanying the manuscript "Merging different allosteric mechanisms: the case of Escherichia coli glutathione reductase"
## the folder has 3 scripts:
1. The first script is a MATLAB solver that solves the equation matrix specified in Equation (A1), based on the reaction scheme depicted in Figure 5.
2. The second is a Jupiter Notebook that searches for sets of parameters for Equation (A3) that produce the maximum Hill number.
3. The third is a Jupiter Notebook that simulates how the internal homotropic Hill number affects the observed external Hill number,
using the parameter set that generates the blue curve in Figure 6, as an example.
